AI-integrated University Management System
Hello there! Welcome to my project, an AI-integrated University Management System. This isn't just another admin tool; it's a smart system designed to make life a little easier for both university staff and students. I built this to showcase how AI and machine learning can be used to solve real-world administrative challenges.

What is this project all about?
This system is designed to streamline day-to-day university operations. But the exciting part is how it uses machine learning. It can actually look at student data to predict academic performance. This helps the university proactively identify students who might need a little extra support, making a real difference in their educational journey.

Key Features
Smart Automation: Automates tasks like class scheduling and student enrollment, freeing up time for staff.

Predictive Analytics: Uses machine learning models to forecast student performance.

Data-Driven Insights: Provides valuable insights into student demographics and trends to help the administration make better decisions.

Technologies Used : 
I used Python for the machine learning backend, and a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end interface. Here are some of the key libraries and languages I used:

Python: For the predictive models and data analysis.

HTML, CSS, & JavaScript: For the user interface and overall web application.

I hope you find this project interesting! Feel free to explore the code and see how it all works.
